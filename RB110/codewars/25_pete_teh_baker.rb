Pete likes to bake some cakes. He has some recipes and ingredients. Unfortunately he is not good in maths. Can you help him to find out, how many cakes he could bake considering his recipes?

Write a function cakes(), which takes the recipe (object) and the available ingredients (also an object) and returns the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake (integer). For simplicity there are no units for the amounts (e.g. 1 lb of flour or 200 g of sugar are simply 1 or 200). Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.

Examples:

// must return 2
cakes({flour: 500, sugar: 200, eggs: 1}, {flour: 1200, sugar: 1200, eggs: 5, milk: 200}); 
// must return 0
cakes({apples: 3, flour: 300, sugar: 150, milk: 100, oil: 100}, {sugar: 500, flour: 2000, milk: 2000}); 

PROBLEM:
input: two hashes
output: integer
- first input hash is ingredients needed
- secong input hash supplies
- integer is how many times all of the needed ing are in the ava ing
- if all of the keys in the first hash are not in second hash then return 0 

EXAMPLES

DATA STRUCTURES:
input two hashes
int: array?
output: integer

ALGORITHM:
- create `number_of_cakes` = []
- iterate over keys/values in the ingredients hash
  - if ingredients key is  in supplies key
    - supplies value/ingredients value push to `number_of_cakes`
  -ohterwise
    - return 0
  return `number_of_cakes` lowest value
=end

def cakes(ingredients, supplies)
  number_of_cakes = []
  ingredients.each do |key, value|
    if supplies.keys.include?(key)
      number_of_cakes << supplies[key]/value
    else
      return 0
    end
  end
  number_of_cakes.min
end
